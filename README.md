SlacK3b
================

**SlacK3b** is a wrapper script around growisofs, cdrecord and mkisofs written in bash using dialog. I wrote this script in 2008 and I'm publishing it now after finding it in one of my backup disks.

The script is not fully functional, I didn't implement all the ideas I had in mind at the time but I'll try and work on it in my spare time.
